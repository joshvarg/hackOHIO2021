New Prescription Target Market States

A target market is, generally, a market performing above average but with significant increases in productivity
possible. It is defined here as a state within the 60-80th percentile range of the ratio of new prescriptions to
total prescriptions. Then, these new prescription totals are given an "optimal projection" by multiplying the 
total prescriptions from that state by the largest ratio of new to total prescriptions ("optimizing" the possible
new prescription total.) These hypothetical increases are then graphed vs current numbers and possible increases
listed beneath the State's image.
